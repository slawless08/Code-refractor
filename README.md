# Homework 1
## Description
The goal of this homework boiled down to a few things including: 
- changing the html code to include semantic elements
- adding the "alt" attribute to images 
- generally, increasing the accessibility

## Key Changes and explanation
My process for changing the code was as follows: 
1. Identify the <div> elements in the html that could be changed to a more fitting semantic element
- For example, a <div> was used with class=header when all that's needed was a <header> tag instead
2. For each tag changed, change the corresponding CSS selector
- For example, when <div class=header> changed to <header>, I changed the selector from .header to header in the CSS file
3. For each image, I added an alt attribute to include a description of the image
4. I reviewed the code each time it was changed to ensure the display and function of the webpage was intacted
5. A title, description, and the order of the items in the <head> were changed to a more easily read order
6. Each change was accommodated with a comment in the code itself

## Questions
One question I have is about the <div class=hero> tag in the html. I wasn't sure if I should change that to something else like a section with a class attribute.
